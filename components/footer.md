#  Component

The website footer is the section of content at the very bottom of a web page. It typically contains a copyright notice, link to a privacy policy, sitemap, logo, contact information, social media icons, and an email sign-up form. In short, a footer contains information that improves a websiteâ€™s overall usability.

## When to Use

 Every page on a website should contain a footer at the bottom of it.

## Accessibility and Usability

- Focus Indicator is the same for a mouse hover or keyboard focus.
- Text in the footer is read by screen readers and can be selected with a mouse.
- Text in the footer should be short and easily scannable.
